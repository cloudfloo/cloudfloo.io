- Service-specific landing pages with tailored content
- Project estimation calculator/configurator
- Meeting scheduling integration (Calendly/Cal.com)

## 3. Advanced Technical Showcases  
- Interactive architecture diagrams for complex solutions
- Live code examples and documentation viewer
- Technical blog with syntax highlighting and interactive examples
- Real-time project status dashboard for clients

## 4. Business Intelligence & Analytics
- Advanced analytics beyond Google Analytics
- Lead scoring and conversion tracking
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- A/B testing framework for continuous optimization

# User Experience  
The website targets three distinct personas:

## Primary Persona: Technical Decision Makers
- CTOs, Lead Engineers, Technical Architects
- Need: Validate technical expertise and cultural fit
- Journey: Services → Team → Case Studies → Contact

## Secondary Persona: Business Stakeholders  
- CEOs, Product Managers, Startup Founders
- Need: Understand business value and delivery capabilities
- Journey: Portfolio → Success Stories → Pricing → Schedule Meeting

## Tertiary Persona: Potential Team Members
- Senior Engineers, DevOps Specialists, Data Engineers
- Need: Assess company culture and growth opportunities
- Journey: About → Team → Careers → Apply

Key UX improvements needed:
- Streamlined contact forms with progressive disclosure
- Interactive project configurator for instant estimates
- Dynamic content based on user behavior and preferences

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation First (Phase 1 Priority)
1. **CMS Database Schema** - Required for all content management
2. **Content API Layer** - Enables frontend integration
3. **Media Management** - Supports all content types
4. **Basic Admin Interface** - Allows team to start managing content

## Quick Wins for Visibility (Phase 1-2 Overlap)
1. **Blog System** - Immediate SEO and content marketing value
2. **Enhanced Contact Forms** - Better lead capture from existing traffic
3. **Team Profile Management** - Showcases expertise more dynamically
4. **Service Landing Pages** - Converts existing service page traffic better

## Building Complexity (Phase 2-3)
1. **CRM Integration** - Requires contact forms to be operational
2. **Lead Scoring** - Depends on analytics tracking implementation
3. **Project Calculator** - Builds on enhanced forms and CRM
4. **Client Portal** - Requires authentication and project management

## Data-Driven Optimization (Phase 3-4)
1. **Analytics Foundation** - Required for all business intelligence
2. **A/B Testing Framework** - Enables continuous optimization
3. **Business Dashboards** - Synthesizes all collected data
4. **Automated Insights** - Final layer of intelligence

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges
**Risk**: CMS integration complexity with existing optimized frontend
**Mitigation**: Use TypeScript-compatible headless CMS (Strapi), maintain strict API contracts, implement comprehensive testing

**Risk**: Performance regression from additional features
**Mitigation**: Implement performance budgets, maintain lighthouse CI, use lazy loading and code splitting extensively

**Risk**: Database performance with increased content and analytics
**Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing strategy, use Redis caching, plan for read replicas

## MVP Scope Management
**Risk**: Feature creep in Phase 1 delaying core CMS functionality
**Mitigation**: Focus strictly on content CRUD operations, defer advanced features to later phases

**Risk**: Overcomplicating lead generation forms
**Mitigation**: Start with enhanced versions of existing forms, add progressive profiling incrementally

## Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Limited design resources for new interfaces
**Mitigation**: Extend existing design system, use headless UI components, focus on functionality over visual novelty

**Risk**: Client work interrupting development timeline
**Mitigation**: Implement features in small, deployable increments that don't break existing functionality
