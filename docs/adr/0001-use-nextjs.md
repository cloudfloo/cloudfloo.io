# 1. Use Next.js App Router

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a modern React framework with excellent performance, SEO support and server-side rendering capabilities.

## Decision
We chose **Next.js** with the new App Router for its built-in routing, streaming and server components. This aligns with our goal of delivering high-performance web experiences with minimal configuration.

## Consequences
- Tight coupling to Next.js release cycle
- Easier deployment with built-in static export and Docker support
